Turns Manga+Press into an image galery

## Description
Manga+Press Gallery Edition allows a user to turn the comic pages into individual galleries. The ability to navigate between each post still exists.

## Changelog
_Don't use just yet. Functionality is very rough or doesn't exist._ __Testers welcome!__
### 0.0.0-alpha
* Rough stages. Removing default Manga+Press meta-box.
#### TODOs
* Check for Manga+Press on activation. If Manga+Press doesn't exist, an erorr message should be displayed since Manga+Press Gallery Edition will require Manga+Press to be installed.
